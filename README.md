# nt-comp-challenge-1

### Project
The goal of this assignment was to create a static site using HTML and CSS that is true to the given comp while responsive on smaller screens. I took liberties with the content of my site, but the layout had to stay true to the comp layout. 

In order to maintain a smooth, easily navigable layout, I swapped hero images once the screen breaks to mobile layout, along with adjusting the static positions of the elements in the prominent tile. Additionally, as the screen gets smaller and tile elements get more rectangular, I decided to let the tile elements span the whole width of the page.
